# Stef und Olis Server mod

This mod is the new version which doesnt use commandblocks and redstone. It uses the bedrock javascript API to make a custom daycycle with a clock on the bottom right. It also comes with some little custom entity behaviors.

- Custom Daycycle (longer)
- Clock on the bottom right
- Players can go into bed (they have to stay on them)
- Only Players in the overworld are affected of the day-night cycle and "bed count"
- Players in other dimensions get a clock which is "out of control" :)
- All Entitys burn on sunlight
- Most Entitys are afraid of cats/dogs
